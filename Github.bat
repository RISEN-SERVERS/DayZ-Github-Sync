:: GUIDE:
:: 
:: Place the above mentioned folder on your desktop. (\Github\Chernarus\mpmissions\ && \Github\Chernarus\profiles\)
:: Copy the files you wish to sync from your profiles & mpmissions folder into the gitfolder. Make sure to NOT include player files, storage_1 files etc or the server will roll back each restart lol.
:: Setup Github on the server (Google is your friend for this.) and have the repository under \Github\Chernarus\profiles\ && \Github\Chernarus\mpmissions\ respectively.
:: On Omega Manager, go to Omega Instance Config and look for "Pre execution script" enable this and setup the correct file path for this bat file eg C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Github.bat
:: Setup Github on your local machine and sync the repos (Google is your friend for this.)
:: Edit server files locally, push them to git and this bat file will pull them from git and transfer them each restart.
:: 
:: IMPORTANT NOTE:
:: Your path CANNOT contain a space. For instance "C:\Omega Manager\servers\" will NOT work. It must be C:\OmegaManager\servers\ or C:\Omega-Manager\servers\ C:\Omega_Manager\servers\ etc etc etc
:: You can setup webhooks so it posts to discord too! https://gist.github.com/jagrosh/5b1761213e33fc5b54ec7f6379034a22

:: As much as I'd love to give support for this, it can be complex to understand for folks who aren't familiar with git, not to mention i'm sure i did a really shit job at explaining this.

:: 
:: I've been looking for something like this for a while, so thought i'd share, given Rearmed refused to reply when I asked for their bat file, 1SK gaming told me to fuck off and they're not sharing anything lol.
:: I'm not sure why everyone needs to be so toxic. Sharing is caring, cunts.
